Explicit Wait: will wait for a specific element and specific condition
        - elementToBeClickable();
        - visibilityOfElement();



                    Implicit Wait vs Explicit Wait

        Implicit Wait:
            - will be created once and it'll affect driver until
            driver.quit() method!
            - Handling noSuchElementException!

        Explicit Wait:
            - will create explicit wait for a specific element and
            when the element executed it will not affect any other element!
            - Handle the exception depends on which method we use!
